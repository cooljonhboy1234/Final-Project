MAN 2021-04-14 4:22PM Log 12:
fixed formating for logging download information of the image on the txt file verison of SQLite database. Reminder that isn't the real SQL database file,
but more of a Download logger/track, actual I'm gonna change the file name so its more suitable for that.

Gonna finally work on the powershell script which will run all the scripts and then taking the image of the day and setting it to my background!

2021-04-14 05:07PM Log 14: 
Add some cool information about the image of the day, each time you download a new image of the day it will give you some information behind the image! Alright back to work on my powershell script.

2021-04-14 08:33PM Log 15: 
About half way done the powershell script gonna manually add a log to explain what happen.

GOOD NEWS I JUST FIXED A HUGE PROBLEM WITH MY POWERSHELL SCRIPT! Basically the issues wasn't with setting the desktop background screen which was easily fixed
by just retyping sleep -Seconds 1 | RUNDLL32.EXE USER32.DLL,UpdatePerUserSystemParameters ,1 ,True. It was that the file run_this which is the powershell script,
it wasn't placed where the rest of the processes are, which made a big fuss since powershell can get annyoing... but no biggy it was the worlds most simplest fix
by moving the run file to the cache folder it fixed everything, wish i figured that one out before spending 3-4 hours on trying to figure out what the problem was.
Oh yea also the powershell script is pretty sweet, it can tell you if the wallpaper is correclty set by printing out HKUC:Control Panel\Desktop and from their you can
iditify if the image is actual set to the background and their is no need to log out and login to switch background it does it automatically. Now to take break before 
I die of over coding OC == OD.

I've manged to fix rundll32 and now the run_this script will always change the background to the image of the day, I move the logging script into a script by its self. 
I'm gonna add to run_script to repeat the code each day by it self.

2021-04-15 10:14PM Log 20: 
I've add the automatic run code feature, just leave powershell running in the background and it will automatically run at the same time the script was run at the pervoius day.
