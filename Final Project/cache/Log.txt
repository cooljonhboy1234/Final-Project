fixed formating for logging download information of the image on the txt file verison of SQLite database. Reminder that isn't the real SQL database file,
but more of a Download logger/track, actual I'm gonna change the file name so its more suitable for that.

Gonna finally work on the powershell script which will run all the scripts and then taking the image of the day and setting it to my background!
